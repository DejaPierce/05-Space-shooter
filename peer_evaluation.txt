Project: Space Shooter Peer-Evaluation
Peer's repository: https://github.com/DejaPierce/05-Space-Shooter.git


What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
It really helps reviewers to be able to review an atleast partially working game/program or add comments or a section in the README.md about what they believe the bug was. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I really like their assests for their game. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I seems like there is a problem with some image file "[PngImagePlugin.py:146] STREAM b'IHDR' 16 13" and AttributeError: 'Window' object has no attribute 'enemy' which leads me to believe there is a problem in the window class in which enemy is not defined correctly. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
The README.md and just comments in general would help. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I was a little confused by the shooting enemies just because I did not implment this feature myself. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes!
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Adding somehting about where they left off would help me figure out how I could try to fix it. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I really enjoyed their game ;)
